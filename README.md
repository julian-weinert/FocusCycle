# FocusCycle Xcode Plugin

FocusCycle is a very simple Xcode plugin that adds two menu items to the window menu.
With the help of these items you can quickly cycle through multiple open Xcode windows.


## Install

1. Build the project to install the plugin. The plugin gets installed in `/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/FocusCycle.xcplugin`.
2. Restart Xcode for the plugin to be activated.

~~**Alternatively, install it using [Alcatraz plugin manager](https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz).**~~ (not yet)

## Usage

Use either one of the two new menu items:

Menu Item|Shortcut QWERTZ|Shortcut QWERTY
---|---|---
Window → Focus Previous Window|⌘⇧^|⌘⇧§
Window → Focus Next Window|⌘^|⌘⇧§

*On other keyboard layouts the shortcuts may differ. Always use the key left next to the "1" (below the "escape" key).*

*The shortcuts refer to ISO keyboards, support for chinese, japanese and other keyboards is unknown.*
