# FocusCycle Xcode Plugin

FocusCycle is a very simple Xcode plugin that adds two menu items to the window menu.
With the help of these items – and their shortcut companions `⌘^` and `⌘⇧^` – you can quickly cycle through multiple open Xcode windows.


## Install

1. Build the project to install the plugin. The plugin gets installed in `/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/FocusCycle.xcplugin`.
2. Restart Xcode for the plugin to be activated.

~~**Alternatively, install it using [Alcatraz plugin manager](https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz).**~~ (not yet)

## Usage

Window → Focus Previous Window ⌘⇧^
Window → Focus Next Window ⌘^
